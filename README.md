# Radar-Security-System

An Arduino based multi-Sensor Radar Security System with a Python GUI was my final year project for my Bachelor of Engineering Technology Degree.

The GUI and Arduino use serial communication to function and neither can operate without the other.

The .ino file must be uploaded to the Arduino while the .py file can be run on any pc with python and relevant libraries installed.

Included alongside these files is the GUI app (located in the dist folder) that does not require an IDE or coding environment to run but does require serial communication with the Arduino.

Additionally I have included images of the wiring guides which can also be found in the Project Report pdf file.

BATTERIES ARE NOT NECESSARY AS THE ARDUINO CAN BE POWERED VIA USB CONNECTION TO THE PC/LAPTOP.
